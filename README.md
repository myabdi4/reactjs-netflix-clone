# reactjs-netflix-clone
 
Firebase Setup
This project includes a basic implementation of Firebase Authentication and API integration. The firebase.js file contains the configuration necessary to connect to a Firebase project. For demonstration purposes, a public Firebase project with restricted access is used.

Setting Up Locally
To run this project locally:

Clone the repository.
Create a .env file in the root directory, based on the .env.example file provided.
Replace the placeholder values with your own Firebase project's details, or use the public project's details if you intend to use the same.
Important Notes
This project is intended for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, sensitive keys and configurations would be managed securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.
Firebase security rules are in place to restrict access and protect resources
